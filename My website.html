		<p> <font size="5"> Our population are increasing rapidly than back in 19s. It took more than a century to make a Billion of the world’s population, but this time it does not even take us hundred year to increasing our population rate. Mostly poor people, they are the one who are to be blame for the increase of the population. More than 60% of the world’s population lives in the country where the economy is very low and their lifestyle is very bad. Rural areas are the most place where by people are increasing the population. So to get information that can be more relevant, I will use questionnaire, observation and internet to collect my data and information. Poor people are the most important people to ask, because they are the ones who have many kids. Also some rich people can be the target, some people who have more than two wife and more than 6 kids. Because I need to get the number of population and how much does everyone is contributing on the population. Thing like birth-rate and death-rate can be used to compare how many people are increasing and how many people are decreasing. If the rate of the birth-rate is too high the death-rate that will be the problem of </p>
		<P>The problem that is effecting us, it’s mostly how we multiply ourselves.
The number of people are increasing every months and every year, the economy is dropping and problems are increasing everyday life. Overpopulation is one of the most problem that lead to poverty, disaster rand crisis. If the birth rate were stable as the infant mortality it could have help the population rate.</font> </p>
